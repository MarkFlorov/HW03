## Data load and preparation before modelling

```{r read_data}
gss16<-read.csv("data/gss16.csv")
```

#### Cleaning and selecting columns

```{r}
gss16_advfront <- gss16 %>%
  select(advfront, emailhr, educ, polviews, wrkstat) %>%
  drop_na()
```

#### Re-levelling `advfront`

```{r}
gss16_advfront <- gss16_advfront %>%
  mutate(
    advfront = case_when(
      advfront == "Strongly agree" ~ "Agree",
      advfront == "Agree" ~ "Agree",
      TRUE ~ "Not agree"
    ),
    advfront = fct_relevel(advfront, "Not agree", "Agree")
  )
```

#### Re-levelling `polviews`

```{r}
gss16_advfront <- gss16_advfront %>%
  mutate(
    polviews = case_when(
      str_detect(polviews, "[Cc]onservative") ~ "Conservative",
      str_detect(polviews, "[Ll]iberal") ~ "Liberal",
      TRUE ~ polviews
    ),
    polviews = fct_relevel(polviews, "Conservative", "Moderate", "Liberal")
  )
```

#### Creating a new `fulltime` variable

```{r}
gss16_advfront <- gss16_advfront %>%
  mutate(fulltime = ifelse(wrkstat == "Working fulltime",TRUE,FALSE))
```


## Exercise 1: Create a linear regression model

#### Exercise 1 (a)

```{r}
gss16_advfront_fit <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(emailhr ~ educ + fulltime, data = gss16_advfront)
tidy(gss16_advfront_fit) 
  glance(gss16_advfront_fit)

```
the summary statistics computed by the glance() function overall show that the model is not a good fit for the data. A low r.squared value (0.08517216), combined with a high sigma value (10.55058) suggest this.
 
emailhr = -3.3516 + 0.5376*educ + 5.2796*fulltime

If a person is working full time, the number of hours they spend on email weekly is expected to be higher, on average, by 5.2796

#### Exercise 1 (b)

```{r}
ggplot(gss16_advfront, aes(x = educ, y = emailhr, color = fulltime)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

Both the "educ" and "fulltimeTRUE" variables have low standard error values in the linear regression fit (0.1137105 and 0.6238310 respectively). This suggests that the coefficients of the two variables are precise in modelling the number of weekly email hours a person has.

Moreover, high t-statistic values for both of these variables (4.727762 and 8.463223 respectively) indicate that they are unlikely to fit the model well by chance, suggesting a genuine impact of education level and job status on the number of hours they spend on email each week.

However, the summary statistics computed by the glance() function overall show that the model is not a good fit for the data. A low r.squared value (0.08517216), combined with a high sigma value (10.55058) suggest this.

overall, the model is not a good one, since the residuals between the regression line and points on the above visualisation are large.

## Exercise 2: Create a workflow to fit a model

```{r split-data}
set.seed(1234)
gss16_split <- initial_split(gss16_advfront)
gss16_train <- training(gss16_split)
gss16_test  <- testing(gss16_split)
```

#### Exercise 2 (a)

```{r}
gss16_rec_1 <- recipe(
  advfront ~ educ,
  data = gss16_train
)

gss16_mod_1 <- logistic_reg() %>%
  set_engine("glm") 
 

gss_wflow_1 <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(gss16_mod_1) %>%
  add_recipe(gss16_rec_1)

```

*Your answer here*

#### Exercise 2 (b)

```{r}
# replace this with your code
```

I have selected a logistic regression model because the dependent variable, advfont is categorical.

#### Exercise 2 (c)

```{r}
gss16_fit_1 <- gss_wflow_1 %>%
  fit(data = gss16_train)
gss16_fit_1
```

## Exercise 3: Logistic regression with single predictor

#### Exercise 3 (a)

```{r}
gss16_pred <- predict(gss16_fit_1, gss16_test, type = "prob") %>%
  bind_cols(gss16_test)
gss16_pred

gss16_pred %>%
  roc_curve(
    truth = advfront,
    educ,
    event_level = "second"
  ) %>%
  autoplot()

gss16_pred %>%
  roc_auc(
    truth = advfront,
    educ,
    event_level = "second"
  ) 
```

#### Exercise 3 (b)

## Exercise 4: Logistic regression modelling and interpretation

#### Exercise 4 (a)

```{r}
gss16_rec_2 <- recipe(
  advfront ~ polviews + wrkstat + educ,
  data = gss16_train) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes())

gss16_mod_2 <- logistic_reg() %>%
  set_engine("glm") 
 

gss_wflow_2 <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(gss16_mod_2) %>%
  add_recipe(gss16_rec_2)
```

*Your answer here*

#### Exercise 4 (b)
  
```{r}
gss16_fit_2 <- gss_wflow_2 %>%
  fit(data = gss16_train)
gss16_fit_2
```
